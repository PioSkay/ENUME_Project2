# ENUME_Project2
A Numerical Method project cointaining 4 tasks. \
## 1. 
Find all zeros of the function. \
f(x) = 3.1 - 3x - e^-x  \
in the interval [–5, 10] using: \
a) the bisection method, \
b) the Newton’s method.
## 2.
Find all (real and complex) roots of the polynomial \
f(x) = a4x^4 + a3x^3 + a2x^2 + a1x + a0 [a4, a3, a2, a1, a0] = [-1, -7, 7, 3, 9]
## 3
Find all (real and complex) roots of the polynomial f(x) from II using the Laguerre’s method. Compare the results with the MM2 version of the Müller’s method (using the same initial points).
